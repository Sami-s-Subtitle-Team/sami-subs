00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.667
I would call this the largest scale
hacking scandal...

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:10.167
we've ever seen in this game.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.900
He was forced to confess, it was not
something that he did willingly.

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.695
It changed an entire two years
of Geometry Dash,

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:19.795
top player history.

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:23.033
I know how much money
he made from YouTube.

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:24.600
It wasn't a small amount.

00:00:25.538 --> 00:00:30.133
All of us have that one game that we share
a very special conection with,

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:33.733
either because it helped us get through a rough time in our life,

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.438
or it allowed us to meet others,

00:00:35.438 --> 00:00:37.100
and form long term friendships.

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:40.933
In my case, that game is Geometry Dash,

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.700
a silly little mobile game
that you even might

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.600
have had on your phone
at some point.

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:50.667
But do not let that undersell you,
on the absolute insanity,

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.581
that has occurred over 
the years in this game,

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.451
Because it turns out, 
I was not alone.

00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:58.106
There's millions of other players
that enjoy the game

00:00:58.106 --> 00:00:59.533
just as much as I do,

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.815
and when a community
like that forms,

00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:05.583
it is only natural
for the game to become competitive.

00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:07.980
OH MY GOD H̸̰͌I̴͉̿ ̷̟̈H̴̘͠Į̷̛ ̵̡͆H̵̻̅I̶̙̒ ̴͈͐Ḫ̸͂I̷̞̽

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:11.068
WHAT, I just beat XO [...]

00:01:11.068 --> 00:01:14.427
It is hard to put into words
the amount of skill,

00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:18.883
these players have, from executing almost pixel
perfect movements,

00:01:18.883 --> 00:01:22.290
to pushing the limits of what
   humans can do in this game.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.760
Tonnes of friendly rivalries
have formed over the years,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.293
with top players helping each other out and cheering
each other on.

00:01:29.293 --> 00:01:32.140
It was all about pushing
the limits together.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.551
However, the story that I'm going
    to tell you today, is what happens.

00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:39.488
When one of those players decides that

00:01:39.488 --> 00:01:41.599
everyone else is worth...

00:01:41.955 --> 00:01:42.818
JACK.

00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:43.977
SHIT.

00:01:43.977 --> 00:01:50.000
[Dramatic Effect]

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.380
Welcome to Geometry Dash.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.663
Originally starting as a mobile game,

00:02:04.663 --> 00:02:07.466
it was eventually released
on Steam a year later.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.493
The gameplay is actually very similar

00:02:09.493 --> 00:02:12.420
to the old classic "The Impossible Game",
but with

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.293
way more layers added
on top of it, including...

00:02:15.293 --> 00:02:16.260
An editor.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.270
This means anyone can go
and create their own unique user levels

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.518
and upload them to the servers 
for others to play.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.394
This feature alone is
basically what has carried

00:02:25.394 --> 00:02:26.980
this game over the years.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.340
The developer himself clearly has shown

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.533
no signs of maintaining the game

00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:35.553
on an active basis, 
which means we rely on players

00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:38.502
to create levels and content
to play and...

00:02:38.503 --> 00:02:40.000
𝕆ℍ 𝕄𝕐 𝔾𝕆𝔻

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.676
they do it well.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.896
This game is truly blessed,
with one of the most passionate

00:03:05.896 --> 00:03:08.172
and creative communities out there,

00:03:08.172 --> 00:03:11.233
A badge that we should wear
proudly wherever we go.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:13.633
But it's not just on the creative side

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:15.005
where players have pushed
the limits

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:16.100
over the years.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.967
Just like in any game,
with difficulty comes glory.

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:22.800
One of the most prestigious titles
any player can hold

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.141
is to be the verifier

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:25.633
of the current hardest level.

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:27.667
The community has
gathered over the years,

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:30.252
to create a list that ranks
levels based

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:31.431
on their difficulty.

00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:33.673
 With the Level that sits 
on the throne on top

00:03:33.673 --> 00:03:35.267
being the current hardest level

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:36.881
that anyone has EVER beaten.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.720
An absolute horrid and treacherous task

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.510
that has taken a toll
on many of the best players

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.220
in the game.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.853
Beating a top one demon is not something
that you do overnight,

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:49.160
it's a journey that can take

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.833
HUNDREADS of thousands of 
attempts to complete,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.073
but at the end you stand as a true

00:03:54.073 --> 00:03:56.220
symbol of determination and skill

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.643
with everyone's attention on you.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.728
So what would happen
if someone tried faking

00:04:01.728 --> 00:04:03.260
their way  to the top?

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.160
[AeonAir] There's a lot of people say
that anyone can beat anything in this game,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.471
which I personally kind of believe.

00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.850
On one end, It's just kind of like
a dedication thing.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.220
But because the game is
so simple by nature,

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.743
the number one player is kind
of like --

00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:20.000
what you should reach after.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.300
Kind of like a swimmer trying
to become Michael Phelps, right?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.800
 
[AeonAir] But without the genetic advantage.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.300
[Samifying] Yeah...
[AeonAir] But without the genetic advantage.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.058
 
[AeonAir] But without the genetic advantage.

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:28.360
The history of the number one player
actually goes really far back.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.387
Over the years a countless
number of players

00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:32.203
have actually shared that title.

00:04:32.203 --> 00:04:34.273
Whoever was considered the best player

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:36.367
was actively beating the hardest levels,

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:38.683
and pushing the boundaries 
of this game further.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.920
This title however would always
be in contention.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.043
For a majority of this game's lifespan,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.213
it actually always was a group of players

00:04:46.213 --> 00:04:47.776
that was hanging around at the top.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.493
You would have constant rivalries
with both sides

00:04:50.493 --> 00:04:52.641
just pushing each other further and further

00:04:52.641 --> 00:04:54.393
and while they were having
an end of the World

00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:56.440
DragonBallZ™ fight up there,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.200
the rest of the community
was trying to keep up

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.700
from an outsiders point of view.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.820
This was absolutely amazing to watch.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.413
Sitting around in streams all day,

00:05:04.413 --> 00:05:07.353
watching them throw attempt
after attempt, at what

00:05:07.353 --> 00:05:09.203
*seemed* to be
an unbreakable wall.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.060
It's like rooting for your
favourite football team.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.320
You want them to succeed,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.913
you want them to beat that level

00:05:14.913 --> 00:05:16.233
because you know how much

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:17.923
work and effort
that they put into it.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.953
There's a certain level of trust

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:23.143
that the community has between them
and the top players.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.430
Trust that...

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.060
Sadly, has been abused 
 in the past before.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.100
As I explained in my Impossible
Levels video,

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.762
one of the biggest rivalries
in Geometry Dash history,

00:05:31.762 --> 00:05:34.073
was between Riot
and Cyclic.

00:05:34.073 --> 00:05:37.530
And if you watched that video,
you know how that turned out.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.510
It turned out Cyclic
had cheated everything.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.390
Apparently not a single one
of his completions

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.690
that we all knew him for,

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.077
that we all loved him for,

00:05:46.077 --> 00:05:47.103
was legit. :(

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.450
This is something that struck A dagger
deep into the heart of the community.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.710
Up until that point,

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.550
It wasn't really precedented that,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.982
a community figure,
someone

00:05:55.982 --> 00:05:57.490
that we all looked up to,

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.418
would abuse our trusts,

00:05:59.418 --> 00:06:00.927
in such a blatant way.

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:05.323
and you would think that from that people
would have learnt! 

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:08.233
When you cheat, Sure! 
Short term, you get lots of attention,

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:10.000
and people think you're actually
good at the game,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.673
but long term... you're
not only hurting yourself,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.453
but an entire community
of genuine,

00:06:16.453 --> 00:06:17.883
hard working players.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.450
And the person I'm going
to talk about today

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.333
for some reason, just didn't get that.

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:25.853
&gt;:(

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:35.250
[TrickGMD] He... he was hard to comprehend
in terms of skill just because it was so-

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.770
He was such a weird player,
that I'd never really seen before.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.988
[WolveZ] Like he was beating stuff...
way faster than anything or anyone else.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.680
It was something like people
have never seen before.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.523
It was like way faster than nswish,

00:06:47.523 --> 00:06:48.713
like faster than anyone.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.030
[Samifying] Put yourself in the mind of
a player in 2020.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.463
At this point, the game has almost
seven years

00:06:54.463 --> 00:06:56.149
of incredible achievements on its back.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.930
We went from hating
on hard levels, to them becoming

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.000
the spectacles of the community.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.800
But even then, at this point in 2020,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.483
new players were improving
faster than ever.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.333
This was an era defined
by a new generation

00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:11.253
of incredibly versatile players,

00:07:11.253 --> 00:07:14.740
that were beating things 
at a faster rate than ever before.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.250
Tartarus, the hardest
level at the time,

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.260
had just received some competition.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.460
A new level was just added
to the Demonlist,

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.988
and some people were saying
it's harder than Tartarus.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.670
This means that for the first time
in roughly 5 months,

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.288
a level was actively 
competing with Tartarus

00:07:30.288 --> 00:07:32.320
for the number one spot
on the Demonlist.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.723
This is a list that archives and ranks

00:07:34.723 --> 00:07:36.250
the 150 hardest levels

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.470
that currently have been completed
by a player.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.100
There was a lot of hype
around this level.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.333
Just like Tartarus,

00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:45.233
it seemed to push the boundaries
of what was possible at the time.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.333
It took the Verifier, nSwish,

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.470
who was considered
the current best player,

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.830
2 entire months and 52,000 attempts
to beat it.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.183
The moment this happens,

00:07:54.183 --> 00:07:56.800
a tonne of top players immediately rushed

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.867
to give it a try and

00:07:57.867 --> 00:07:59.200
get progress themselves.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.100
These players...

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.167
Included Sviborg, rori, Wolvezz,
Crisis and Doggie.

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.367
All players that were
about to become household

00:08:06.367 --> 00:08:07.467
names in the community.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.033
However, there was one player
that kind of stood out from the rest,

00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:13.733
someone almost nobody had heard of 
at the time.

00:08:13.733 --> 00:08:15.367
"SpaceUK"

00:08:15.367 --> 00:08:17.600
This guy was a nobody.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.733
To put it bluntly, before this,

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:22.667
only some players were actually
even aware of his existence

00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:23.433
to begin with.

00:08:23.567 --> 00:08:27.833
But that's only part of the reason
why this completion is kind of special.

00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:30.200
Apparently it was his FIFTH

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.267
ever Demon.

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:37.723
[SpaceUK] I BEAT THE GOLDEN!

00:08:37.723 --> 00:08:38.448
[Friend] Oh, you did?

00:08:38.448 --> 00:08:39.200
[SpaceUK] Yeah!

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.125
Holy $h!t, that was one attempt.

00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:43.014
(claps) 
HOLY $H!T

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:56.001
[TrickGMD] That was like-

00:08:56.001 --> 00:08:59.533
hearing "The Golden", as a top one, 
being your... like, fifth demon or whatever!?

00:08:59.533 --> 00:09:00.910
was unheard of...

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.500
[AeonAir] To the naked eye, he 
came out of nowhere...

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.767
like we knew he existed,

00:09:03.767 --> 00:09:04.767
and knew he was doing it,

00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:06.567
but no one really cared
until he actually did it.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.333
[Samifying] This was insane.

00:09:08.333 --> 00:09:10.367
A demon is the hardest difficulty rating

00:09:10.367 --> 00:09:11.633
a level can receive,

00:09:11.633 --> 00:09:13.833
and it is split into 5 subsections,

00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:16.364
ranging from "Easy Demon"
to "Extreme Demon".

00:09:16.364 --> 00:09:18.767
Up until this point, 
beating any level that has

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.233
reached extreme demon status,

00:09:20.233 --> 00:09:22.567
would normally be a monthslong journey,

00:09:22.567 --> 00:09:23.893
where you would consistently

00:09:23.893 --> 00:09:26.760
practise and hone your skills
to prepare yourself

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.963
for an upcoming battle.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.470
You would not just do
this overnight.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.350
Playing an extreme demon

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.707
is one of the toughest
things you can do in this game,

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:35.753
and even then,

00:09:35.753 --> 00:09:38.650
just being categorised
as an extreme demon

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.603
doesn't even mean
that it's in the Demonlist.

00:09:40.867 --> 00:09:43.283
There's tonnes of extreme levels
out there now,

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:46.700
but we only actively keep 
track and rank the top 150.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.700
HERE is why This entire thing
was kind of insane.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.733
This is "SpaceUK"'s progression
as a player.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.720
He started playing the game roughly
in 2019,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.703
and then beat his first ever demon "DeCode".

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.198
A really easy demon that
is a great introduction

00:10:10.198 --> 00:10:12.083
to playing harder levels in the game.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.267
As his second ever demon,

00:10:14.267 --> 00:10:17.102
he immediately decided to jump
to an Insane Demon:

00:10:17.102 --> 00:10:19.102
"windy landscape".

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.835
As his third, he decided to go
for another insane demon,

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:28.835
 "Layak".

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:36.460
That already... kinda was amazing.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.620
New players should not
choose insane demons,

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.967
as their second and third ever.

00:10:40.967 --> 00:10:43.700
You're supposed to show
a gradual increase in difficulty,

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.251
which intern helps you practise
different skill sets.

00:10:46.567 --> 00:10:48.867
From having a heavy focus
on the wave game mode

00:10:48.867 --> 00:10:50.167
to being memory based,

00:10:50.167 --> 00:10:53.472
 there's tonnes of different styles that 
you should actively practise.

00:10:53.724 --> 00:10:56.233
So what did "Space" do next?

00:11:46.633 --> 00:11:50.233
[AeonAir] A lot of people give "Space" credit
to be like the original Jumper,

00:11:50.467 --> 00:11:52.233
and with jumping, it...

00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:55.067
basically means going
from one level to a much,

00:11:55.067 --> 00:11:56.700
much, significantly harder level.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.170
And "Space" was like the *pioneer*
of that method.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.840
Going for the #2 demon
at the time as his 5th.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.233
[Samifying] it's really hard to put
into perspective

00:12:05.233 --> 00:12:06.533
how big of a jump this is.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.450
This was the moment that
first catapulted him

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.223
into the mainstream community,

00:12:11.223 --> 00:12:13.098
and little did people know,

00:12:13.098 --> 00:12:15.700
that this was *still* just the start.

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:26.112
(Frantic Panting)

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.090
[SpaceUK] Oh, this level is SO $H!T

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.240
This level is so F______ $h!t.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.933
[Samifying] Not only... did he beat the Golden,

00:12:35.933 --> 00:12:39.467
but three months after that decided
to go for Tartarus,

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.890
and a month after that
for Zodiac.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.140
At this point in time,

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.570
this player that just came out of nowhere

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.303
had beaten the entire

00:12:47.303 --> 00:12:48.953
top five hardest levels ever.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.960
He was slowly cementing himself

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.279
as the fastest improving player
the game had ever seen,

00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:55.633
and he wouldn't stop there.

00:12:55.633 --> 00:12:58.867
It was level after level after level.

00:12:58.867 --> 00:13:01.767
He just started destroying
the Demonlist.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.863
[Varium] It was also just like...
 mind blowing and impressive,

00:13:04.863 --> 00:13:08.595
to just see someone so nonchalantly, Like,

00:13:08.595 --> 00:13:09.460
SHRED

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.843
the entire demon list.

00:13:10.843 --> 00:13:11.343
[Samifying] Mhm...
 

00:13:11.343 --> 00:13:11.995
[Samifying] Mhm...
[Varium] like (scoffs) there's no better way to put it.

00:13:11.995 --> 00:13:13.158
 
[Varium] like (scoffs) there's no better way to put it.

00:13:13.158 --> 00:13:14.369
 
[Varium] He just SHREDDED everything.

00:13:14.369 --> 00:13:15.462
[Samifying] Damn...
[Varium] He just SHREDDED everything

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:17.391
It seemed like he was here
to stay.

00:13:17.391 --> 00:13:20.400
Throughout 2021, he would just be on a tear,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.678
gaining more respect and therefore
more attention

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:25.967
with every completion that he uploaded.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.067
It was so insane, in fact,

00:13:28.067 --> 00:13:30.933
that it would actually lead
to his nomination as the best

00:13:30.933 --> 00:13:33.803
player of 2021 alongside Crisis,

00:13:33.803 --> 00:13:35.710
Wolvezz and Trick.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.683
But there's probably one more thing
that I forgot to mention.

00:13:52.367 --> 00:13:54.567
It's October the 24th...

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:56.800
Tartarus was roughly one month away

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.204
from having its second anniversary
on top of the list.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.504
No other level in the history of the game
has survived this long on top.

00:14:04.504 --> 00:14:08.170
The only one that ever came close
in any way was Bloodlust,

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.300
with its one year and two-month
reign on top.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.443
This is an achievement
filled with tonnes of history

00:14:13.443 --> 00:14:15.467
that would kind of deserve a video on its own.

00:14:15.467 --> 00:14:18.733
But the reason I'm telling you this
is because on this date,

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:20.600
Tartarus was denied its

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.133
2nd anniversary on the top.

00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:43.667
[SpaceUK] Ohh.

00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:44.167
 
*cough*

00:14:44.167 --> 00:14:44.667
*cough*
 

00:14:45.046 --> 00:14:45.676
*HARD CAUGH*

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:46.302
ohmygo-

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.150
I can't F______ react,
otherwise

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.400
I'm gonna cough so much.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.180
hu

00:14:52.317 --> 00:14:53.547
h o m y g a w d

00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:05.233
It was verified by "SpaceUK" in what's known
as the closed verification race.

00:15:05.233 --> 00:15:07.333
This is when the original creators

00:15:07.333 --> 00:15:09.667
of the level choose
a specific amount of players

00:15:09.667 --> 00:15:11.533
to just race for the verification,

00:15:11.533 --> 00:15:13.017
almost as a sort of:

00:15:13.017 --> 00:15:15.267
"Here it is, and good luck."

00:15:15.267 --> 00:15:17.533
This means that for the case
of Slaughterhouse,

00:15:17.533 --> 00:15:19.323
any of these ten players could have been

00:15:19.323 --> 00:15:23.165
the first to beat the level legit
in a big race for glory.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.830
Whoever survived that first
would have their name written down

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:27.930
as the player to push

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.113
the limits of the game
to a whole new level.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.342
And that is exactly what "Space" did.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.283
"Space" was *such* a dominant
force in that race

00:15:37.283 --> 00:15:39.393
that people were already using it
as a reason

00:15:39.393 --> 00:15:42.050
to nominate "Space"
as the best player for that year.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.263
Which, we now know, he won!

00:15:45.263 --> 00:15:46.653
By a landslide, at that.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.370
This alone would already
be insanely impressive by itself,

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.513
but Slaughterhouse was special.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:56.833
It wasn't just the level to one up Tartarus, 
so it could get placed a step above,

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.520
it was a *L E A P*  in difficulty

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.080
to show you just how much
it was ahead of its time.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.577
To this day in May 2023,
"Slaughterhouse"

00:16:05.577 --> 00:16:08.210
sits on the number four spots
on the Demonlist.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:08.963

Tartarus sits at #20.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.680
Do you realise how insane that is?

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.378
The longest surviving level
to ever be on top,

00:16:21.378 --> 00:16:23.775
has been pushed down by 21 spots,

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:25.321
in one and a half years.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.025
As you can see, a LOT of stuff
has happened in those two years,

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.546
and "Space" would play a really big part in that.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.000
People weren't aware of it back then, but

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.910
the next two years were about
to become known,

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.273
as the Slaughterhouse Era.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.860
The level would remain on top
for the next 10 months.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.027
Which is a testament
to how fast players were

00:16:45.027 --> 00:16:45.953
actually improving.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:46.950
At this point,

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.190
"Space" had overtaken the rest of the world,

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.490
and was officially crowned
the number one player,

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.093
purely based on stats alone.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.780
That would be a title that he would hold
for a really long time,

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.151
because you see...

00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:01.123
 he was nowhere near his peak yet.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.630

00:18:11.175 --> 00:18:11.869
I JUST BEAT ACHERON x 5

00:18:12.127 --> 00:18:12.934
I JUST BEAT ACHERON x 6

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:13.821
I JUST BEAT ACHERON x 7

00:18:14.048 --> 00:18:14.726
I JUST BEAT ACHERON x 8

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.443
[Samifying] At this point, he basically had
achieved everything a player

00:18:20.443 --> 00:18:22.253
*can* achieve in this game.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:23.883
Acheron marked the third time

00:18:23.883 --> 00:18:25.043
that "Space" had conquered

00:18:25.043 --> 00:18:27.310
a new top one demon over the years.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.310
He eventually also went on
to not only beat the top 10,

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.990
not only beat the top 20,

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:34.439
but the entire main Demonlist.

00:18:34.439 --> 00:18:34.939
YEAH!

00:18:34.939 --> 00:18:37.481
all 75 levels completed
by just one player.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.730
I can only imagine,
how many upcoming players

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.890
were actually looking up to him
at this point.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.420
He must have been such a big inspiration
to so many people.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.440
"Space" himself was doing
absolutely amazing.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.120
His YouTube channel was popping off,

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.037
he had garnered the respect
of every player in the community,

00:18:54.037 --> 00:18:55.633
and it seemed like he would go down

00:18:55.633 --> 00:18:56.660
in the games history,

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.070
for being the best player to ever touch this game.

00:18:59.726 --> 00:19:05.092
Until April 2023, where one notable 
player *finally*

00:19:05.449 --> 00:19:07.567
 dared to ask the question:

00:19:07.567 --> 00:19:09.360
"Hey Space!"

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.850
"Why do your clicks not line up
with your gameplay?"

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.630
I would call this the largest scale
hacking scandal...

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:22.833
we've ever seen in this game.

00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:27.440
He was forced to confess, it was not
something that he did willingly.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.030
He changed an entire two years
of Geometry Dash,

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.153
top player history.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.740
I know how much money
you made from YouTube,

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.270
It wasn't a small amount.
